# CellexalVR_ExampleLogFile

This repository contains a Portable Log file documented with screen capture videos showing a default analysis in our virtual realitiy data analysis platform [CellexalVR](https://cellexalvr.med.lu.se/) ([on github](https://github.com/sonejilab/cellexalvr)).

The main purpose of this repository is to explain how the different actions in VR are documented in a portable html document.

The portable log files are created during a VR session in the Output folder downstream of the main CellexalVR folder:
```
Output/<username>/<dataset name>/PortableLog<time stamp>.zip
```

[This zip file](./PortableLog_2021_06_30_14_38_56.zip) has to be extracted before the html report can be correctly displayed in a normal browser like firefox or chrome.

The zip includes [this html log file](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/stela2502/CellexalVR_ExampleLogFile/blob/main/PortableLog_2021_06_30_14_38_56/session-log-for-session-2021-06-30-14-38-56-1.html) which has been created analyzing our example mouse dataset.
The html file has afterwards been modified to include explanation and links to the videos hosted on youtube.
